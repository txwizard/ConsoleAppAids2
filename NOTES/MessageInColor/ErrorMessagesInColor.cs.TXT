    Namespace:          WizardWrx

    Class Name:         ConsoleAppAids.ErrorMessagesInColor

    File Name:          ErrorMessagesInColor.cs

    Synopsis:           Expose a combination of static and instance methods that
                        reduce writing console messages in any supported
                        combination of foreground and background colors to
                        method calls that mirror the Console.WriteLine methods
                        that you already know and use.

    Remarks:            This is a wrapper for the like named class in the
                        WizardWrx.ApplicationHelpers.DLLServices namespace and
                        class library, which makes the class directly visible
                        through the WizardWrx.ConsoleAppAids namespace and class
                        library. This is a workaround to maintain backward
                        compatibility with versions of this library that
                        originally implemented it.

    /// There are two identical sets of methods.
    ///
    /// 1) Static methods write text in your choice of foreground and background
    /// colors, then revert the console colors to their initial values (that is,
    /// the values they had when the program loaded).
    ///
    /// 2) Instance methods go a step further, by maintaining a record of the
    /// current colors, so that the colors can progress through a range, without
    /// reverting to the initial colors.
    ///
    /// For each overload of Console.Error.Write, there are corresponding static
    /// and instance methods. The only difference in their signatures is that
    /// these methods specify a foreground color and a background color,
    /// followed by the same arguments that would apply to the corresponding
    /// overload of the Console.Error.Write method.
