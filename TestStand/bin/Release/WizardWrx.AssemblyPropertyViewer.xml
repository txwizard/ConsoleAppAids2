            <summary>
            The Public Key Token property, which is null, and returns a
            string value of null, unless the assembly has a strong name. If
            the assembly has a strong name, this string returns the public
            key token of the key with which the assembly was signed.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Use of this enumerated value is DEORECATED.
            
            Use the PublicKeyToken property, which always returns a correct
            value, which is null, unless the assembly has a strong name.
